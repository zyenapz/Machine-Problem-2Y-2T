        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
        Founded in early 2021, Data Wiz is owned by the start-up Web Wizards, Incorporated. 
        Our small and nascent start-up consists of a small team who operates in the city of Cabuyao, Laguna near the Malayan Colleges campus. 
        The team consists of 4 undergraduate students who are under the BS Computer Science program. 
        Our team envisions to expand our operations towards overseas and to become a globally competitive e-commerce platform that is capable of challenging and competing with already established e-commerce platforms.
